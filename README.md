# SalaryPrediction-based-on-yoe-and-cgpa
this is my Linear regression model which i built from scratch using stochastic gradient descent algorithm. in this application user inputs cgpa and yoe and the model returns the predicted salary. Flask is used for backend .

this is my first Machine Learning project. It gives an r2 score of 0.9054. I also tested the scikit-learn's linear regression model and it gave r2 score 0.8810 on this data.

The deployment stage(and related updates in this repo) of this project on vercel was helped by @Sougata-Mondal -https://github.com/Kisuke-Urahara-Code-Whiz
Special thanks to him for taking his valuable time to help me deploy my first project.
